# ADS-B and AIS Multifeeder Aggregator

This project runs on a Raspberry Pi and aggregates radio signals from both ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillanceâ€“Broadcast) and AIS (Automatic Identification System) sources. 
It collects and forwards aircraft and vessel positional data to online aggregators for personal tracking, research, or contribution to public datasets.

## Features

- **ADS-B Signal Reception:** Collects aircraft data using a compatible radio receiver and processes it in real-time.
- **AIS Signal Reception:** Receives vessel tracking information from AIS broadcasts.
- **Data Aggregation:** Combines ADS-B and AIS feeds for streamlined processing.
- **Forwarding to Aggregators:** Pushes data to multiple public aggregators (e.g., ADS-B Exchange, FlightAware, MarineTraffic, or others you configure).
- **Lightweight Setup:** Designed to run efficiently on Raspberry Pi devices.

## Setup & Installation

For detailed instructions on setting up your system, including hardware requirements, software installation, and configuration, 
please refer to the [SDR-Enthusiasts ADS-B Guide](https://sdr-enthusiasts.gitbook.io/ads-b/). This comprehensive guide covers:

- **Receiving ADS-B Data:** Using `adsb-ultrafeeder` with an RTL-SDR dongle.
- **Feeding Data to Online Services:** Configuring feeders for services like ADS-B Exchange, FlightAware, and more.
- **Storing and Visualizing Data:** Utilizing tools like InfluxDB, Prometheus, Grafana, and tar1090.
- **System Preparation:** Installing Docker and setting up your Raspberry Pi environment.
